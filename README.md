# Avocado Sales Analysis 

###### Probabilistc Machine Learning exam 2020-2021

###### Group members: *Cavuoti Lorenzo*, *Ferfoglia Irene*

## Introduction
We analyzed and predicted the future trend of avocado sales in the US by year.

The prediction was performed with Gaussian Processes, Random Forest and XGBoost.
The hyperparameters were tuned using Bayesian Optimization techniques with scikit-optimize
